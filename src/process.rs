//! Process state management implementation.
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! This module implements a composite process state machine that tracks both
//! the primary lifecycle state of a process and auxiliary event flags for
//! parent notification via `waitpid`.
//!
//! ## State Model
//!
//! The process state is represented by two components:
//!
//! 1. **`ProcessStateKind`** - The primary lifecycle state:
//!    - `Running`: Process is executing or ready to execute.
//!    - `Stopped`: Process is stopped by a signal or ptrace.
//!    - `Zombie`: Process has terminated but not yet been reaped.
//!
//! 2. **`ProcessStateFlags`** - Event acknowledgement flags:
//!    - `STOPPED_UNACKED`: A stop event has occurred but not yet reported to
//!      parent.
//!    - `CONTINUED_UNACKED`: A continuation event has occurred but not yet
//!      reported to parent.
//!
//! These are combined in the `ProcessState` struct, which encapsulates all
//! state transitions and ensures invariants are maintained.
//!
//! ## State Transitions
//!
//! State transitions are managed through explicit methods on `ProcessState`:
//!
//! - `transition_to_stopped(signal, ptraced)`: `Running` → `Stopped` +
//!   `STOPPED_UNACKED`
//! - `transition_to_running()`: `Stopped` → `Running` + `CONTINUED_UNACKED`
//! - `transition_to_zombie(info)`: Any state → `Zombie` (clears all flags)
//!
//! ### Important Invariants
//!
//! - A `Zombie` process cannot transition to any other state.
//! - The `CONTINUED_UNACKED` flag is only valid when `kind` is `Running`.
//! - The `STOPPED_UNACKED` flag is only valid when `kind` is `Stopped`.
//! - Flags are automatically set during transitions and consumed atomically by
//!   `waitpid`.
//!
//! ## Interaction with `waitpid`
//!
//! Parent processes use `waitpid` with options like `WUNTRACED` and
//! `WCONTINUED` to wait for child state changes. The event consumption flow is:
//!
//! 1. Child transitions (e.g., `Running` → `Stopped`), setting the
//!    corresponding flag.
//! 2. Parent calls `waitpid(WUNTRACED)`, which internally calls
//!    `try_consume_stopped()`.
//! 3. `try_consume_stopped()` atomically checks and clears the
//!    `STOPPED_UNACKED` flag.
//! 4. If successful, the event is reported exactly once to the parent.
//!
//! This ensures that each state change event is reported exactly once,
//! preventing duplicate notifications and race conditions.
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//!
//! The `ProcessState` is protected by a `SpinNoIrq` lock within the `Process`
//! struct. All state queries and transitions must acquire this lock, ensuring
//! atomic updates even in concurrent scenarios (e.g., signal delivery while
//! parent is waiting).
//!
//! ## Ptrace Integration
//!
//! Ptrace stops are represented as `Stopped { ptraced: true, signal }`. They
//! differ from signal-stops in key ways:
//!
//! - Ptrace stops are NOT consumed by standard `waitpid(WUNTRACED)` calls.
//! - They are handled separately via `check_ptrace_stop()` in the ptrace
//!   subsystem.
//! - Resuming from ptrace stops goes directly to `Running` (no `CONTINUED`
//!   event).
